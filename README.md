# High-Performance RF Mixer and Multistage Cascaded Low-Pass Filter  

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and hardware validation of a **precision RF mixer** and a **multistage cascaded low-pass filter**.  
The system performs **frequency downconversion** of GHz signals into the **low-frequency acoustic band** and applies multistage filtering to suppress noise and unwanted harmonics.  

##  Technologies & Tools  
- **LTspice** ‚Äì Circuit design and simulation  
- **Analog Circuit Design** ‚Äì BJT-based RF mixer, RC & LC filter stages  
- **PCB Implementation** ‚Äì Hardware assembly and testing  
- **Oscilloscope FFT Analysis** ‚Äì Signal verification and performance validation  

##  Key Features  
- Implemented a **BJT-based RF mixer** to downconvert GHz signals.  
- Built a **cascaded RC‚ÄìLC low-pass filter** to achieve sharp cutoff and strong stopband attenuation.  
- Validated system performance with **FFT spectrum analysis** on an oscilloscope.  

##  Results  
- Successful downconversion of high-frequency RF signals to the acoustic band.  
- Clear noise suppression and improved signal integrity through cascaded filtering.  
- Hardware prototype demonstrated results consistent with LTspice simulations.  


## üöÄ Future Improvements
